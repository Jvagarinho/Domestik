1. Color Palette (Modern Pastel)

The idea is to use colors that evoke freshness and confidence.

Primary Color (Action): Pastel Mint Green (#B2D8D8) – Conveys freshness and "job done". Use for confirmation buttons.

Secondary Color (Highlight): Soft Sky Blue (#A7C7E7) – Conveys confidence and professionalism. Use for icons and headers.

Supporting Color (Financial): Peach or Apricot (#F8C8DC) – Use to highlight earned values ​​(Total for the Day/Month), creating a soft contrast.

Background: Off-White (#F9F9F9) – To keep the interface light and avoid eye strain.

2. Visual Element Style
For a modern and clean look:

Rounded Corners (Border Radius): Use generous rounding (approximately 12px to 16px) on all buttons and cards. This gives a friendly and modern appearance.

Soft Shadows: Avoid solid black lines. Use very light and diffused shadows to add depth to the service cards, making them appear to "float" on the background.

Typography: * Titles: A modern and geometric Sans-Serif font (e.g., Poppins or Montserrat).

Body Text: Something very legible (e.g., Inter or Roboto).

3. Interface Layout (Screen by Screen)
A. Dashboard (Main Screen)
Summary Cards: At the top, two or three colored cards (in different pastel shades) showing: "Monthly Earnings", "Total Hours", and "Next Service".

Floating Button (FAB): A large circular button in the bottom right corner with a + icon for "Add New Day". This should be the most vibrant color element in the palette.

B. Registration Form
"Clean" Inputs: Input fields with white backgrounds and very thin light gray borders.

Visual Selectors: Instead of just writing the client's name, use small colored "chips" or labels to quickly identify each client by color.

C. History List
Grouping by Month: Divide the list with subtle titles (e.g., "January 2024").

Card Design: Each job entry should be a white card. On the left side, a thin vertical bar with the color assigned to the client; on the right side, the total value highlighted.

4. Suggested Micro-Interactions
Success Feedback: When saving a service, show a small mint green "check" animation.

Empty States: If there are no registered services, show a minimalist illustration in pastel tones with a motivational phrase such as "Ready to start the day?"
